# Pathfinder Route Optimization

While the bulk of the Pathfinder business logic is contained in the [Scala Play! backend server](https://github.com/csse497/pathfinder-server), the problem of route optimization is implemented as a stand-alone Julia microservice.

Documentation for Pathfinder route optimization is hosted on [pathfinder.readme.io](https://pathfinder.readme.io). It is split into [route optimization](https://pathfinder.readme.io/docs/route-optimization-as-a-linear-program) and the [objective function dsl](https://pathfinder.readme.io/docs/objective-function-dsl).
